# Contributing Guidelines

We love improvements to our tools! However, this repo is in an experimental state and is undergoing the messy process of early development. If you aren't deeply familiar with the tools and desired results, you might want to take a look at some of the other web-monitoring repos for now.

If you are interested in contributing to this or other EDGI projects, please check out the general [guidelines for contributing][edgi-contributing] and [code of conduct][edgi-conduct] for all of our organizational repos.
